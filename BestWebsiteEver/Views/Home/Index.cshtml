            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>The extraordinary baker-engineer. David dances between flour and code, creating a harmonious blend of passion and precision. By day, he’s a flour whisperer, coaxing dough into edible poetry. His kitchen becomes a sanctuary where bread sings, cookies become galaxies, and cakes ascend like sweet cathedrals. But when the sun dips, David swaps his apron for an anti-static wristband. In his computer workshop, he’s a silicon sorcerer, building machines that defy convention. His computers—extensions of his soul—tell stories of neon-lit gaming rigs, minimalist workstations, and humming server farms. Late at night, David stands at the confluence of flour and code, balancing warmth and logic. If you visit his apartment, expect the aroma of cinnamon rolls mingling with the soft hum of processors—a delicious collision of flour and bytes.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Recipe: Binary Biscuits</h2>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup butter (softened)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 egg (beaten)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <p><strong>Initialize the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Think of it as booting up your baking environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Binary Mixing:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, butter, and sugar. Mix them together until you achieve a binary blend—0s and 1s merging seamlessly.</p>
            <p><strong>Egg Injection:</strong> Add the beaten egg to the mixture. Imagine it as injecting a vital code snippet into your dough. Stir until well-incorporated.</p>
            <p><strong>Vanilla Debugging:</strong> Pour in the vanilla extract. It’s like debugging your code—adding that sweet flavor to eliminate any bitter bugs.</p>
            <p><strong>Baking Powder Optimization:</strong> Sprinkle in the baking powder. This is your optimization step—making sure your biscuits rise just the right amount.</p>
            <p><strong>Salt Encryption:</strong> Don’t forget the pinch of salt! It’s like encrypting your data—adding a touch of complexity to enhance the overall flavor.</p>
            <p><strong>Roll and Cut:</strong> Roll out the dough on a floured surface. Use cookie cutters to create binary shapes: 0s, 1s, or even tiny microchips.</p>
            <p><strong>Bake the Code:</strong> Place your binary biscuits on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake them in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes. Watch them transform from raw code to golden perfection.</p>
            <p><strong>Cooling Algorithm:</strong> Once baked, let them cool on a wire rack. The cooling algorithm prevents runtime errors (burned tongues).</p>
            <p><strong>Enjoy the Output:</strong> Finally, savor your Binary Biscuits with a cup of coffee or tea. Each bite represents a byte of happiness—a perfect blend of flour and code.</p>
