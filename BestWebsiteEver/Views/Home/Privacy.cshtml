            <h2>Japanese Castella Cake</h2>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup (130g) cake flour, sifted</li>
                <li>2/3 cup (130g) sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (60ml) honey</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (60ml) warm water</li>
                <li>6 large eggs, separated</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Mix the honey with warm water and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth. Gradually add half of the sugar, whisking until the mixture is pale and thick.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add the remaining sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.</li>
                <li>Gently fold the meringue into the yolk mixture. Sift the cake flour into the mixture and fold gently until just combined. Incorporate the honey syrup.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for about 50-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Remove the cake from the oven and drop the pan from a foot height onto the counter to prevent shrinking. Let cool completely in the pan.</li>
                <li>Once cooled, slice the cake and serve. Optionally, dust with powdered sugar before serving for an added touch of sweetness.</li>
